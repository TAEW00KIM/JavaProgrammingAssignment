The so-called Korean Wave, or Hallyu, started with television dramas.
Recently, however, the genre that has been leading the New Korean Wave in
China is K-pop and its idol groups. News about K-pop music and idol
groups is being broadcast in real-time via digital broadcasting and the
Internet. Among the many K-pop artists, Tiara, Girls’ Generation, Big Bang,
and Jang Na-ra are very famous in China. Almost immediately after the
release of Big Bang’s new album, the group had four new songs listed at the
top of Chinese music charts.

Korean movies are also popular in China. Late Autumn, starring Hyun
Bin, ranked second in the China box office as soon as the movie was
released in March of this year.
Hallyu in China is expanding to various cultural areas, including not
only dramas, K-pop, and movies, but also food, games, fashion, tourism,
and consumer products.
