Since the late 1990s Hallyu has undergone some significant changes and has evolved from a regional phenomenon into a global cultural phenomenon. First and foremost, its evolution is connected with the process, which Oh Ingyu, a member of the International Association for Hallyu Studies, defines with the term glocalisation [Oh 2017: 157-167]. 

As doramas and K-pop, being the base of the Korean wave, originated in the process of foreign products adaptation (the former were created with the orientation towards Japanese “trendy dramas” of the 1980s, the latter was influenced with the American and European dance music of the 1990s and the turn of the 21st century) they may be considered products of high-quality localization prevailing trends of global popular culture. 

However, Hallyu phenomenon is not a mere copy or adaptation of creative sphere products of donor-countries for local standards, but creative reception and further transformation of their content and insertion of national specificity in them. Due to this, new forms of popular culture created in the “Korean wave” frameworks could go beyond the boundaries of one country and spread not only across East and South East Asian countries, but also through the world media space. 

Thus, the successful reception of foreign products by Korean doramas and music producers let “the Korean wave” gain fame and spread its cultural influence through the world. In this context the phenomenon of cultural transfer of Hallyu products to the countries of East-Asian and South East-Asian regions deserves separate consideration. It seems possible to speak of this process like of a new glocalization wave.
